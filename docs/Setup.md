# Setup and Running

SIREN is Python-based. The dependencies/requirements to run SIREN are listed in requirements.txt. To install the dependencies:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

SIREN also uses the [MyMediaLite](http://mymedialite.net) toolbox to provide recommendations. MyMediaLite is written in C#, for the .NET platform and it should run on every architecture supported by [Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/). It is therefore suggested to download and install Mono prior to running SIREN.

After all the dependencies have been installed, run SIREN:

```python
python3 simulation.py
```
